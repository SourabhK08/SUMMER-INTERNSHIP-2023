// Setup
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line

Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Example:

const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
firstLetter would have a value of the string C.
